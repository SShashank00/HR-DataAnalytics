# End-to-End Data Analytics Project with Power BI

## Introduction
In this end-to-end data analytics project, we will take a REAL dataset for employee presence from a company called AtliQ and perform data analysis in Power BI. We invited an HR from AtliQ Technologies who conveyed her requirements, and we built a Power BI dashboard for her to help her with employee insights. This project is perfect for your data analyst resume as it is built on a real dataset (and not the toy dataset).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from AtliQ and contains information about employee presence.

## Project Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Exploring the dataset to understand patterns and trends.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Building interactive dashboards in Power BI.
- **Insights Generation:** Drawing meaningful insights to help HR in decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Python (for data preprocessing if applicable)

## Usage
